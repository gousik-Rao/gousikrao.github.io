# Hi, I'm Gousik.

> **Computer Science Undergraduate | Full-Stack Developer**
> *Aspiring AI Engineer & Architect | Incoming Master's Candidate (Germany 2026)*

### 🎯 Vision: AI Infrastructure & LLMs
My long-term goal is to transition from building robust web applications to architecting the **AI infrastructures of the future**.
* **The Goal:** To work as an AI Engineer within the German tech ecosystem, focusing on the scalability and deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs).
* **The Path:** Leveraging my strong foundation in Backend Engineering (Java/Spring Boot) to understand the "plumbing" required to support massive AI systems, while specializing in AI during my Master's.

### ⚡ The High-Performance Mindset (Sports & Strategy)
I believe that physical resilience fuels mental sharpness. My career is defined by the intersection of **Software Engineering** and an **Athlete's Discipline**.

* **🏁 The Athlete's Edge:** As a sports player, I am trained in endurance and split-second decision-making. I bring this same intensity to coding—treating deployment deadlines like game days and debugging like tactical defense.
* **🎮 Strategic Gaming:** My interest in strategy games (*Clash of Clans, GTA V*) isn't just a hobby; it’s a practice in resource management and economy balancing—skills that translate directly to optimizing database queries and system resources.
* **🎧 Flow State:** Powered by high-tempo music (Hans Zimmer, Anirudh), I cultivate deep focus sessions to solve complex architectural problems.
